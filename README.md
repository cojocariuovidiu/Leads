#Leads 
"Leads" is an Angular lead management app.
It is a work in progress, but also in use by several people in the real world.

1. By me to track contracting opportunities
2. By a trade broker to track their business opportunity prospects
3. By a photographer (ok that's me again) to track commercial sales prospects and potential galleries   

###Secondary Role
Leads is also a display case for how I might approach a RESTful MEAN project, depending on size. 
 
###Open to Users
Soon, I will be opening up this app for general consumption, at no charge.
Once I get a few more important features sewn up, it will be available.
I promise.    

###Use of Other Modules
Leads uses several other modules I have published on [github](http://gmilligan.github.io).
Which proves 2 things:

1. There is reuse in software.
2. I am willing to eat my own dog food.

Those modules currently include:

 * [MongoWrap](https://github.com/gmilligan/mongowrap)
 * [xs-angular-action-buttons-directive](https://github.com/gmilligan/xs-angular-action-buttons-directive)
 * [xs-angular-ui-components](https://github.com/gmilligan/xs-angular-ui-components)
 * [xs-angular-wizard](https://github.com/gmilligan/xs-angular-wizard)

I find this app useful in keeping the embarrassment of forgotten phone calls in check.
If you have something to keep track of, stop back by for a login, soon.
